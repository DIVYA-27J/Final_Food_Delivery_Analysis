Food Delivery Data Integration

Project Overview

This project focuses on integrating and analyzing data from multiple food delivery sources to gain insights into delivery performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. Using Python and data analysis techniques, the notebook consolidates raw data, cleans it, and generates meaningful visualizations and metrics.


Objectives

* Collect and integrate food delivery data from multiple sources.
* Clean and preprocess the data for accurate analysis.
* Analyze delivery patterns, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.
* Visualize insights using charts and plots to support decision-making.
* Identify trends and areas for improvement in the delivery process.


Datasonet Description

The project uses a Food Delivery Dataset, which may include the following:

* Order ID
* Customer location
* Restaurant location
* Delivery time
* Order rating
* Payment method
* Order amount

Note:Data is cleaned and merged for consistent analysis.

Key Features

* Data integration from multiple sources
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps
* Insights on delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction



Expected Outcomes

* Understand average delivery times across regions and restaurants
* Identify peak order times and patterns
* Detect bottlenecks in delivery process
* Provide recommendations for optimizing delivery operations
* Support data-driven decision making for food delivery services



Tools and Technologies

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* GitHub for version control
